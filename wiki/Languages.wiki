#summary How to use HeeksCAD in another language

== German ==

There already exists HeeksCAD/de/HeeksCAD.po

You must compile this into HeeksCAD.mo

   For Linux, get the gettext package, then in terminal go to HeeksCAD/de folder and type "msgfmt -o HeeksCAD.mo HeeksCAD.po"

   After you have done "sudo make install" for HeeksCAD, you must copy the HeeksCAD.mo file to /usr/local/share/heekscad/de   ( I type "sudo nautilus" to open a folder browser with permission to copy to this folder ).

Now when you type HeeksCAD, if your computer is in German mode, you will see HeeksCAD with translations.
