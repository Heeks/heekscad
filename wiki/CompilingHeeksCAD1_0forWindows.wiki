How to build HeeksCAD 1.0 for Windows

I used a 64bit SONY VPCCB running Windows 7

download and install TortoiseSVN software from here http://tortoisesvn.net/
make a new folder on your computer somewhere, called HeeksCAD1.0
I made this folder "C:\Dev\HeeksCAD1.0"
right click on the HeeksCAD1.0 folder and do "TortoiseSVN"->"SVN Checkout..."
The "URL of repository":
http://heekscad.googlecode.com/svn//branches/v1_0/
The Checkout directory something like:
C:\Dev\HeeksCAD1.0
Press OK.
It should checkout all the HeeksCAD 1.0 source code


Get Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition ( it's free, but about 1GB ) or use full version.

Download and install the Open CASCADE installation. I am currently using 6.5.2. http://www.opencascade.org/getocc/download/loadocc/ ( OpenCASCADE652.exe )

Download and install the wxWidgets installation. I am using 2.8.12. http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.8.12/wxMSW-2.8.12-Setup.exe/download

Set an environment variable called WXWIN to be
C:\wxWidgets-2.8.12
or whereever wxWidgets installed to. ( to set an environment variable go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> press "Environment Variables" button -> in "user variable" add new ).
( you must restart Visual Studio for it to know the new environment variable )

Edit C:\wxWidgets-2.8.12\include\wx\msw\setup.h changing "#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 0" to "#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 1" and changing "#define wxUSE_ODBC 0" to "#define wxUSE_ODBC 1" 

Open C:\wxWidgets-2.8.12\build\msw\wx_dll.dsw ( let VC2008 convert the projects ). Change the configuration to "DLL Unicode Release" or to "DLL Unicode Debug" if you will be building HeeksCAD in Debug mode.
Press "Build Solution" 

Copy 4 of the dlls that get made from C:\wxWidgets-2.8.12\lib\vc_dll to HeeksCAD ( the folder you checked out this project to ).

They are: wxbase28u_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28u_aui_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28u_core_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28u_gl_vc_custom.dll

or if you are building Debug

wxbase28ud_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28ud_aui_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28ud_core_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28ud_gl_vc_custom.dll 

Make an environment variable called
CASROOT
with value of
C:\OpenCASCADE6.5.2\ros

Get libarea source code:
	make "C:\Dev\libarea"
	SVN Checkout in the same way but with libarea instead of HeeksCAD


   add an environment variable to your computer
   
   called
   LIBAREA_PATH
   with value as where your libarea code is, for example for me it is
   C:\Dev\libarea



copy all the dlls from C:\OpenCASCADE6.5.2\ros\win32\vc8\bin to C:\Dev\HeeksCAD
copy all the dlls from C:\OpenCASCADE6.5.2\3rdparty\win32\tbb\bin to C:\Dev\HeeksCAD
copy the dlls from C:\OpenCASCADE6.5.2\3rdparty\win32\freeimage\bin to C:\Dev\HeeksCAD

Open "C:\Dev\HeeksCAD\src\HeeksCAD VC2008.sln"
Change configuration to "Unicode Release" or "Unicode Debug"

Press "Build Solution"

If it builds OK, press "Start Debugging" 




==VC2003 and VC2005==

To use VC2003 or VC2005, run vc_retro.py ( you will need to install Python first ).

This will make .vcproj and .sln files for VC2003 and for VC2005.
